*	Content of this package
**********************************************************************
 This package has been set up to give quick help on how to generate i-vectors using ALI/LIA_RAL
 To try it out, please dowload ALIZE/LIA_RAL sources. After compiling the sources, please copy LIA_RAL *.exe" into the ./bin/ directory.
 Then run the bash script IV.sh
 
 -  ./bin/ 		strore your binaries in this directory
 
 - ./cfg/		configuration files proposed for i-vector extraction are store in this directory
 
 - ./data/		contains a small set of data (acoustic features and label files) used for this demo.
			These data are part of the RSR2015 database.
